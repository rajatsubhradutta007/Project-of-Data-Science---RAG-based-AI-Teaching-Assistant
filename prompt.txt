I am teaching web development in my Sigma web development course. Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":"Lect","number":"1","start":68.28,"end":72.56,"text":" for anyone interested in learning more about Python programming."},{"title":"Lect","number":"1","start":0.0,"end":6.2,"text":" Hi there, my name is Avi and welcome to this brand new introduction to Python programming"},{"title":"Lect","number":"1","start":23.42,"end":29.36,"text":" teach a wide variety of concepts, from comprehensive Python programming to Apple Watch development,"},{"title":"Lect","number":"3","start":267.0,"end":272.0,"text":" I'll wrap this up with an important feature of Python, which is called slicing."},{"title":"Lect","number":"4","start":0.0,"end":6.92,"text":" Hey guys, Avi here, and welcome back to our series on Python programming."}]

"tell me all about python"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
